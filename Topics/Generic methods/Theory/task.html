<p></p>
<p>Let's take a look at examples of generic static and instance methods and find out how they are used.</p>
<h5 id="generic-static-methods">Generic static methods</h5>
<p>The following static method is declared as generic. The declaration of the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3770" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a generic type is a generic class or interface that is parameterized over a type, which is determined when a developer creates an object of the class or invokes the method. | Generic types enable the writing of more abstract code and the development of reusable software libraries. A generic class, for example, named `C&lt;T&gt;` can store a value of some type `T`. It is possible to create an object with a concrete type, such as `C&lt;Integer&gt;` or `C&lt;String&gt;`. The class does not know the concrete type on which it operates, and the concrete type must be specified when creating an instance of the class.">generic type</a> <code class="language-java">T</code> surrounded by angle brackets allows us to use this type in the method. We remind you that it can belong to a generic or a non-generic class because it does not matter for generic methods.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static &lt;T&gt; T doSomething(T t) {
    return t;
}</code></pre>
<p>The type parameter <code class="language-java">T</code> can be used to declare the return type and the type of the method's arguments. A generic method can take or <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a return value is the result that a method gives after executing its logic. | A method can return a value of a specific data type, or it can return no value, using the void keyword. If a method has a return type, it must include a return statement to provide the result. When invoking a method that returns a value, you can store it in a variable, print it, or pass it as an argument to another method.">return values</a> of non-generic types as well. For instance, the following method takes a generic array and returns its size as an <code class="language-java">int</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static &lt;E&gt; int length(E[] array) {
    return array.length;
}</code></pre>
<p>A generic method's body is declared like that of any other method.</p>
<p>We can pass an array of integers to the method we defined earlier and find its length:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Integer[] array = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
int len = length(array); // pass an array of Integers</code></pre>
<p>We could use this same method to find the length of an array of Strings (or any other <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5035" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a reference type is a type of variable that stores a reference to an object located elsewhere in memory, rather than storing the object's value directly. | When an object is created using the new operator, it returns a reference to the location of the object in memory, allowing access to its fields and methods. Reference types can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, and returned as values from methods. They are important for creating complex, object-oriented programs in Java. Unlike primitive types, which store their values directly, reference types store a reference to an object. When comparing reference types using the == operator, it compares the references (memory addresses) rather than the actual values. Additionally, assigning one value of a reference variable to another creates a copy of the reference, rather than the value itself. Reference types can also refer to a special value that represents the fact that it is not initialized yet or does not have a value. It is important to note that in Java, the heap is the region of memory where objects are stored and allocated dynamically during runtime.">reference type</a>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String[] stringArray = { "a", "b", "c", "d" };
len = length(stringArray); </code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Recall that type parameters can represent only reference types, not <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a primitive type is one of eight built-in data types provided by the language. | They are represented by keywords and are not objects, unlike reference types. Primitive types are divided into groups based on their meaning, and each group operates similarly but has different sizes and ranges of value. The most commonly used primitive type is `int`, which represents an integer number. Java also provides several types for integer and fractional numbers, which are often used in arithmetic expressions. Primitive types store their value directly, unlike reference types that store a reference to an object located elsewhere.">primitive types</a>.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>As another example of a generic method, take a look at one that prints the elements of a generic array.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static &lt;E&gt; void print(E[] array) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
        System.out.print(array[i] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}</code></pre>
<p>Let's create an array and print it using this method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Character[] characters = { 'a', 'b', 'c' };
print(characters);</code></pre>
<p>The output will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">a b c </code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>In this example, we used the <code class="language-java">void</code> keyword in the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a declaration is a statement that introduces a variable, method, or class into the program. | It specifies the type of the entity being declared, its name, and other relevant information such as access modifiers, return type (for methods), and initial values (for variables). For example, the declaration of a method may include its name, return type, access modifier, and parameter list. Declarations are essential for Java to understand the structure and behavior of the program. Incorrect declarations can lead to compilation errors. Java 10 introduced type inference, which allows developers to use the var keyword instead of a specific type, and the type is automatically inferred based on the assigned value.">declaration</a> of the method because the method does not return anything.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Just like in generic classes, the type parameter section can contain multiple type parameters separated by commas.</p>
<p>For instance, the following method declares two type parameters.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static &lt;T, U&gt; void method(T t, U u) {
    // do something
}</code></pre>
<p>Static generic methods are often used to write generic algorithms that do not depend on the type they operate on. This can be convenient when the method has to be used independently from the class it belongs to. We frequently use generic static methods for different operations with arrays and collections: sorting an array, searching for a value in a collection, reversing an array, and so on.</p>
<h5 id="generic-instance-methods">Generic instance methods</h5>
<p>Just like static methods, instance methods can have their own type parameters. There is no difference in their declaration compared to static methods, excluding the absence of the <code class="language-java">static</code> keyword.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class SimpleClass {
 
    public &lt;T&gt; T getParameterizedObject(T t) {
        return t;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The class above does not provide a type parameter, so we have to specify the type parameter in the method declaration to make the method <code class="language-java">getParameterizedObject</code> generic.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Note that in this example we cannot use <code class="language-java">T</code> as the type for a field in the class, because it belongs to the method rather than the class itself.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Now we can create an <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance of a class refers to a unique object that is created from a class blueprint. | It has its own state and behavior, and can be created using the `new` keyword or through reflection. Instances of a class can be compared using the `equals()` method, but it's important to note that the default implementation of this method in the `Object` class checks for reference equality, not value equality. In the given context, the focus is on comparing instances of a class, specifically two instances of a class that represent date and time. The author emphasizes the importance of knowing how to get an instance of a class, as it allows for the creation of unique objects that can be compared and manipulated.">instance of the class</a> and invoke the method. It will return a value that has the same type as the value that was passed in.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">SimpleClass instance = new SimpleClass();
Integer value = instance.getParameterizedObject(601); // this will return 601</code></pre>
<p>Although generic methods can belong to non-generic classes, it is more common for a generic method to belong to a class that is also generic. Below is an example of a generic class that contains a generic instance method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class SimpleClass&lt;T&gt; {
 
    public &lt;U&gt; T getParameterizedObject(T t, U u) {
        return t;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The method receives arguments of both the class's type (<code class="language-java">T</code>) and the method's own type (<code class="language-java">U</code>). Because <code class="language-java">T</code> was already declared in the class header, the method only has to declare the generic type <code class="language-java">U</code>.  The method returns the variable of type <code class="language-java">T</code>.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Generic methods are a must-have for programmers since they allow us to restrict the scope of type parameters to a single function. Type parameters in generic methods can be used as return types or as types for arguments passed to the function. Both static and instance methods can be generic.</p>
